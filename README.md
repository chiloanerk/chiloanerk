👋 Hi, I'm Rele Chiloane! 

💻 I'm a passionate Full Stack Web Developer with expertise in front-end and back-end technologies. My main focus is on creating efficient and scalable web applications with a strong foundation in scalable web services and effecient database management. My other interests are in dev ops workflows, I get enjoyment in making development processes easy for myself and others.

🎓 I have recently completed a 3 year IT diploma at the University of South Africa, where I gained comprehensive knowledge of software and systems development principles, IT management, networking, and database management systems.

🌟 I'm actively seeking collaborative opportunities on open-source projects. I love being part of a diverse team, contributing my skills, and learning from other talented developers. If you have a project that needs an extra pair of hands, let's connect!

🚀 On my to-do list: 2024/05/06 Rebuilding my encrypted user-generated content site that fosters community engagement and empowers individuals to share their ideas and stories. I believe in the power of collaboration and the positive impact it can have on building vibrant online communities.

📚 My favorite technologies: I have hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, VueJs, PHP & MariaDB/MySQL, C#, VB.NET, Java, some C and a bit of Python. I'm always eager to explore new tools and frameworks to expand my skillset.

💡 When I'm not coding, you can find me spending time with my family, reading the latest tech blogs, or fixing machines as I am also a qualified earthmoving mechanic. I believe that diverse experiences fuel creativity and enhance problem-solving abilities.
