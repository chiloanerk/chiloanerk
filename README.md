👋 Hi, I'm Relebogile Chiloane! 

💻 I'm a passionate Full Stack Web Developer with expertise in front-end and back-end technologies. My main focus is on creating efficient and scalable web applications with a strong foundation in database management.

🎓 I have recently completed an IT diploma at the University of South Africa, where I gained comprehensive knowledge of software and web development principles, IT management, networking, and database management systems.

🌟 I'm actively seeking collaborative opportunities on open-source projects. I love being part of a diverse team, contributing my skills, and learning from other talented developers. If you have a project that needs an extra pair of hands, let's connect!

📫 You can reach me at: chiloane.rk@live.com. I'm always open to discussions, job opportunities, or just casual tech chats. Feel free to drop me a message!

🚀 On my to-do list: Building a user-generated content site that fosters community engagement and empowers individuals to share their ideas and expertise. I believe in the power of collaboration and the positive impact it can have on building vibrant online communities.

🌐 Check out my portfolio website to explore my projects and learn more about my work: this github for now (https://github.com/chiloanerk)

📚 My favorite technologies: I have hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, VueJs, PHP & MariaDB/MySQL, VB.NET, Java, some C and a bit of Python. I'm always eager to explore new tools and frameworks to expand my skillset.

💡 When I'm not coding, you can find me spending time with my family, reading the latest tech blogs, or fixing machines as I am also a qualified earthmoving mechanic. I believe that diverse experiences fuel creativity and enhance problem-solving abilities.

🌈 Let's connect and build something awesome together! Feel free to reach out, and let's discuss how we can collaborate on exciting projects or share insights to help each other grow as developers.
